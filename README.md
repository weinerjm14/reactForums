## What is reactForums

For non-developer web community admins who need a quick, customizable community building solution, { reactForums } is a free and open source web based forum app software that provides robust community platform tools out of the box. Unlike many popular forum options available, our software was built with the future of tech and online communities in mind.

Since the dawn of Web 2.0, online communities have changed and broadened to include far more people than originally anticipated. Users have now come to expect a particular set of features in the communities they frequent. At the same time, developers seem to have moved away from the old PHP way of doing things and are now embracing newer (and debatably better!) tech. With both of these things in mind, we have built our community-building software using Facebook's [React](http://reactjs.org) with those expected features built in to the core of our software.

With { reactForums }, you shouldn't have to worry about the dirty details of web development, your community can happily grow with our community-focused features, and you can do it with an eye towards the future of web.
